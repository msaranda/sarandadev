You know that feeling when you have too many thoughts, writing is too slow, and talking to a real person would overwhelm them? I built a tool for that.

Click button. Speak. It saves as markdown. That's it. Not smooth, not perfect, but it works when I'm overwhelmed.

Why this and not other voice apps? Because I own the data. Later I can build analytics on it, train AI on my patterns, whatever. Right now it just catches the brain dump.

If you have ADHD and hate journaling, try it. Self-hosted only, data stays yours.
