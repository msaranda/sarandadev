# Introduction
*Who:* I'm Maciej, I work as a software engineer in a software house on a daily basis. 
*Problem:* I'm overstimulated and the existing tools suck
*Solution:* Building tools for my ADHD brain, sharing the process
*Why public:* So others like me can benefit while I figure my shit out
*What to expect:* Messy progress, honest failures, working code

*Mission:* "I build tools that help overstimulated brains think clearly. Starting with mine."
