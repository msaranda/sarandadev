# Clean Workspace rules

## Purpose
The purpose of this document is to build rules in order to maintain a clean work environment and promote good habits.

Why I actually started with it? 

Many years ago I fell into total mess of keeping everything visible on my desk or keeping many tabs open.
Now, I want to declutter my life and build a solid line between today's and yesterday's work.

That's my first habit I want to introduce in my decluttered workspace. 

Today is day one!

## Milestones and rewards

### Execution steps - building up the habit
- [ ] For 7 days -> start with closing all tabs after end of the work day
- [ ] For 7 days -> make sure the computer is completely shut down after the work day
- [ ] Task -> Plan 1 hour of time to spend it on cleaning up Downloads directory
- [ ] For 7 days -> keep the Downloads directory empty
- [ ] Task -> Provide the rest of the plan

### Tracking

## The rules

### Keep the browser clean
- Each open topic must be organised inside a folder in Zen browser
- There might be at most 1 open topic and 3 waiting
- All the other topics must be moved to Obsidian notes
- Clean things up after the work day so you can start from scratch next day
